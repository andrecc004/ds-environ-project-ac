# Urbanization and Bee Communities: Oregon Bee Atlas Project

This repository contains the research files, R Markdown analyses, and annotated bibliography for a project exploring how **urbanization and habitat fragmentation** influence **bee community composition, seasonal resource gaps, and species specialization** across Oregon. The analysis uses data from the **Oregon Bee Atlas** and integrates additional environmental and land-use datasets.

Overview

**Objective:**  
To test whether urban regions show *lower late-season bee richness* and whether *generalist species* are overrepresented in cities compared to rural landscapes.

**Core Research Questions:**
1. Do urban sites exhibit seasonal resource gaps that reduce late-season bee diversity?


**Key Datasets:**
- **Oregon Bee Atlas** (species occurrence & sampling data)
- **NLCD Impervious Surface Dataset** (urbanization index)
- **PRISM Climate Data** (temperature & precipitation normals)
