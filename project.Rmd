## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r bees}
# Load packages (install first if needed)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)  
library(sf)      

# Path to your file
bee_path <- "/Users/andrecc/Desktop/DSCI/410Project/OBA_2018-2024.csv"

# Read in
bee_raw <- read_csv(bee_path)

# Quick peek
glimpse(bee_raw)

```

```{r}
