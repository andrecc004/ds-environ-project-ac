  abstract = {Ayers and Rehan review how urban environments shape bee communities. They examine studies from North America and Europe that compare bee abundance, richness, and traits across urban, rural, and natural areas. The authors explain how nesting strategy, dietary breadth, and phenology influence which species remain common in cities. They also summarize how local factors like garden plantings and landscape features such as impervious cover influence bee diversity. The review highlights consistent patterns across regions, including higher numbers of generalist species and the loss of specialists. Evaluation: This review is strong because it synthesizes a large body of field studies and links ecological traits to urban responses in a clear way. The design relies on secondary data, so patterns depend on the quality and variation of the original studies. Studies come mostly from eastern North America and Europe, which limits geographic coverage. Relevance: This paper supports my hypothesis that urban areas tend to filter bee communities toward generalists. It provides a foundation for interpreting trait patterns in Oregon Bee Atlas data.

  abstract = {Davey and colleagues study how honey bees in Oslo use pollen across the growing season. They collect pollen from hives at several sites and identify plant taxa using DNA metabarcoding. The authors compare early, mid, and late season pollen composition and relate these patterns to plant availability in the surrounding landscape. They find strong seasonal changes in pollen use, with different plant groups dominating different parts of the year. Late season pollen richness is often lower than early season richness. Evaluation: The study has strong molecular methods and clear sampling across seasons. Honey bees have broad foraging ranges, so pollen may come from areas outside each sampling site. Results focus on honey bees rather than wild bees, which may not show identical patterns. Relevance: This study supports the idea that seasonal shifts in floral resources can influence bee foraging. It strengthens the rationale for testing whether late season resource gaps affect wild bee richness in Oregon. Tags: phenology, pollen, metabarcoding},

  abstract = {Summary: NLCD provides nationwide land cover data, including a layer that gives percent impervious surface in each 30 meter pixel. Impervious cover includes pavement, roofs, and other built structures. This product uses Landsat imagery and classification algorithms to estimate urbanization intensity. It is widely used in landscape ecology to quantify urbanization, development, and habitat fragmentation. Evaluation: NLCD covers the entire country with consistent resolution and methods. It may miss small features or misclassify mixed surfaces at the pixel level, and it updates every few years rather than annually. Relevance: Impervious percent is the project's main measure of urbanization. Extracting impervious cover around each OBA site helps test how development relates to seasonal bee richness.

The dataset includes monthly values and long term averages. The PRISM Climate Group uses topographic and meteorological information to improve climate predictions in complex landscapes.

Evaluation: PRISM offers high spatial quality, but modeled climate products may smooth small scale temperature differences. It is updated regularly, although individual months may not match real time values exactly. Relevance: PRISM provides the seasonal climate data needed for this project, such as mean temperature in each season. These values help test whether climate differences influence seasonal richness.

The review shows that natural areas hold the highest bee richness, but many cities still support diverse bee communities. They note that urbanization tends to reduce specialist species while increasing the number of generalists. The authors also mention the importance of plant diversity, green space size, and habitat connectivity for maintaining bee communities. Evaluation: The review is comprehensive and draws on many studies from different climates. Because it covers broad themes, site-specific details may be lost. It summarizes past work rather than just collecting new data. Relevance: This work supports testing both trait filtering and seasonal richness patterns. It also motivates the use of land cover data such as NLCD to quantify urbanization. Tags: review, urbanization gradient, landscape ecology},

They compare bee richness, abundance, and trait composition across farms, gardens, and urban landscapes. They also record floral richness at each site. They find that overall bee diversity can remain high in urban settings when floral resources are abundant. However, total richness and abundance do not always increase with urbanization. The study also notes shifts toward species with generalist diets and cavity nesting habits in cities. Evaluation: This study has strong field methods with clear classification of sites and floral resources. It focuses on one region, which may limit generalization. Sampling covers only one year. Relevance: This paper helps frame how floral richness interacts with urbanization. It supports my decision to include floral richness and impervious cover as key predictors.
