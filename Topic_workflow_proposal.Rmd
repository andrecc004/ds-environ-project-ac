1. Topic

Impact of urbanization/habitat fragmentation on bee communities in Oregon, with emphasis on (a) potential seasonal resource gaps in cities and (b) community shifts toward generalist species.

2. Research Questions

Late-season richness: Do urban sites exhibit seasonal resource gaps that reduce late-season (Aug–Oct) bee richness compared to less urban sites?

Generalists vs. specialists: Are generalist bee species proportionally more common in urban areas than in rural/natural mosaics?

3. System & Data

Core: Oregon Bee Atlas (species, date, location; statewide volunteer survey).

Urbanization & land cover:

NLCD Impervious Surface (% impervious as urbanization index).

USDA Cropland Data Layer (land-use intensity; crop context).

Climate & elevation (controls):

PRISM monthly temperature/precipitation normals.

USGS 3DEP elevation.

Phenology (floral timing):

OregonFlora bloom windows (by species/region).

(Optional) ALAN / traffic for sensitivity: VIIRS night lights; OSM roads / FHWA AADT.

Assumed repo paths (adjust as needed):

data/raw/ (unzipped sources)

data/processed/ (merged, analysis-ready)

docs/references.bib, docs/apa.csl

Writing
Core R packages

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)

Writing
Project paths (edit to match your repo layout)

dir_raw <- here::here("data", "raw")
dir_proc <- here::here("data", "processed")
dir_figs <- here::here("analysis", "bee_figures")

if (!dir.exists(dir_proc)) dir.create(dir_proc, recursive = TRUE)
if (!dir.exists(dir_figs)) dir.create(dir_figs, recursive = TRUE)

4. Variables & Operational Definitions

Response variables

Richness (S) by site × season (Spring = Mar–May; Summer = Jun–Jul; Late = Aug–Oct).

Generalist proportion: share of individuals/species labeled “generalist” (vs. specialist), based on a trait table (family/genus-level proxy if species-level not available).

Predictors

Urbanization: NLCD % impervious within buffer(s) (e.g., 500 m and 1000 m).

Land-use context: CDL crop/cover proportions in buffer.

Phenology context: # of plant taxa blooming per month (OregonFlora lookup).

Climate controls: PRISM mean temp/precip (seasonal).

Elevation (USGS 3DEP).

Sampling effort control (if available): # visits or net time per site × season.

5. Workflow & Methods
5.1 Data Ingest & Cleaning
Writing


Assumptions, Limitations & Biases

Sampling bias: Volunteer effort varies spatially/temporally; control via effort proxies if available.

Trait resolution: Specialist/generalist classification may be imperfect; use family/genus proxies with sensitivity checks.

Ethics & Data Management

Cite all sources; avoid revealing sensitive locality information for rare species.

Keep raw data read-only; document all transforms in data/processed/.

Store CRS/projection metadata; include a DATA_DICTIONARY.md.

Reproducibility Plan

Scripted pipeline in this Rmd; seed-setting and sessionInfo() below.

All figures saved to analysis/bee_figures/.

References managed via references.bib + apa.csl.
